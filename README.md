**ENIAC – Data Analysis for Market Expansion in Brazil**
📌 **Introduction**

ENIAC, a company specializing in Apple-compatible products, is exploring entry into the Brazilian market through Magist. To support this decision, we analyzed Magist’s delivery and operations data (2016–2018) to evaluate logistics performance, customer behavior, and potential challenges.

**📊 Data Description**

The dataset provided by Magist covered multiple aspects of e-commerce operations:

Orders Table – customer orders and delivery timestamps

Order Items Table – detailed product-level data for each order

Products Table – product details including categories

Product Translation Table – Portuguese-to-English product name mapping

Order Reviews Table – customer ratings and feedback

Customers Table – customer demographics and locations

Sellers Table – seller data including geolocation (latitude, longitude)

**🛠 Tools & Technologies**

**MySQL** → Data cleaning, querying, and transformation

**Tableau** → Data visualization and dashboards

**Google Slides** → Presentation of results to stakeholders

**🔍 Analysis Performed**

On-time vs delayed deliveries (definition: products delivered on or before estimated date)

Delay distribution by product categories (highlight: 20% of delays are tech products)

Average delivery times and shipping costs

Geographical analysis of sellers and customers across Brazil

Customer satisfaction through review scores

**📈 Key Insights**

90% on-time delivery, but tech products contribute to 20% of delays

Longer delays often linked to heavier, high-value products

Delivery inefficiencies more significant in remote regions

Higher shipping costs for tech products (~18€ average)

Geographic clustering of sellers impacts delivery speed

**✅ Conclusion & Recommendation**

Magist provides a strong entry point into Brazil with cost and logistics advantages. However, challenges remain with tech product delays, long lead times, and high import taxes.
We recommend using Magist as a short-term partner while ENIAC prepares to establish its own supply chain for long-term scalability and brand protection.
